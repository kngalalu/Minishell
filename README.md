# Minishell
The objective of this project is for you to create the simplest start of a shell
script.

# Introduction
The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT. At the time, all coders agreed
that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously
irritating. It was only logical that they came up with the idea to communicate with
a computer using an interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close
to english

# Objectives
Through the Minishell project, you will get to the core of the Unix system and explore
an important part of this system’s API: 
* process creation
* synchronisation. 

Executing a command inside a shell implies creating a new process, which execution and final state
will be monitored by its parent’s process.
This set of functions will be the key to success
for your Minishell, so be sure to code the cleanest, simplest program possible.

# Specification Of Task
* You must program a mini UNIX command interpreter.
* This interpreter must display a prompt (a simple "$> " for example) and wait till you type a command line, validated by pressing enter.
* The prompt is shown again only once the command has been completely executed.
* The command lines are simple, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced functions.
* The executable are those you can find in the paths indicated in the PATH variable.
* In cases where the executable cannot be found, it has to show an error message and display the prompt again.
* You must manage the errors without using errno, by displaying a message adapted to the error output.
* You must deal correctly with the PATH and the environment (copy of system char **environ).
* You must implement a series of builtins: echo, cd, setenv, unsetenv, env, exit.
* You can choose as a reference whatever shell you prefer.
* You must manage expansions $ and ˜
